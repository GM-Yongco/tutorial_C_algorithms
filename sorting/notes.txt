==================================================
 BUCKET SORT
==================================================
this is first cuz i needed to present this

steps
	go through one loop to insert the values into a buckets with ranges in order
		usually closed hash table
		ex 1: 
			you could insert to the hash table a list of decimals 
			the hash value based on their first decimal digit
			and the hash table size would be 10 starting from 0-9
	we then sort each bucket
		GeeksGorGeeks uses insertion sort
	we then assume the values are sorted and insert each value in order in the bucket and by order of buckets
	
lil bit by jules:
	if you know the distribution of the values you can make more efficient bucket
		i assume bucket sort will perform worse with imbalanced buckets
			because insertion sort within a bucket scales time complexity exponentially
			while the number of buckets scales the time complexity linearly
		we can make the range distribution of the buckets/hash value 
			be based on the area under the distribution curve
			giving better chances of a balanced bucket distribution

	best			:
	average			: O(n^2)
	worst			: O(n^2)

notes
	: Edware Harry Friend, first known person to describe the algo in a math paper
	: Kenneth E. Iverson coined is current term

 COMB SORT
==================================================

creator				: WÅ‚odzimierz Dobosiewicz and Artur Borowy
when				: 1980
time complexity		: O(n^2)
	best			:
	average			: O(n^2)  
	worst			: O(n log(n))
in_place			: yes
space complexity	: O(1)
stable				: no
notes
	: is basically gapped bubble sort
	: has fewwer comparisons than bubble sort
